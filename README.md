## Game Play

## Requirements

Node >= 8.0

Angular 7 & Angular CLI 

MongoDB 


## Development

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Running Dev Environment

Make sure MongoDB is up and running.

Frontend: in the frontend folder we run the Angular dev environment:
```sh
ng serve
```
This serves the frontend on localhost:4200

Server: in the main folder we start the dev server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
This serves requests on localhost:3000 ( watch not implemneted yet ).

The dev login is not secure, a valid email will work with any string as a token.



### Project Details

A single page application using Angular 7 front end, Express server, Socket.io, and MongoDB database.  A single session cookie is stored on users machine.

#### Server Design

A RESTful API was built using Node and Express.  In addition to this API we have implemented a Socket.io interface which integrates closely with the frontend in supplying real time data to players in a game.


#### Client Design

The front end was built using the Angular CLI tools and conforms to Angulars expected design.  There is essentially one main module with a number of individual components mounted on specific routes.  Services are used as well.

#### Database Design

MongoDB was chosen for the database in order to allow storage of objects.  Q was used to promisify the interface and Mongoose was used to connect the database and server.  The size of the record for MongoDB is 16MB so our game object which is large is still within the size limit.

There are seven tables in the database as listed below.  The Users and Games table are the only talbes that are ever changed - during game play and new user creation.

1. [Pokemon](pokemonTable.md) 
1. [GymLeader](gymLeaderTable.md)
1. [ItemCards](itemCardsTable.md)
1. [EventCards](eventCardsTable.md)
1. [Sprites](spritesTable.md)
1. [Users](usersTable.md) - stores users of the app and is updated when a new user joins and also when users join a game
1. [Games](gamesTable.md) - stores the game state and is updated on every turn
